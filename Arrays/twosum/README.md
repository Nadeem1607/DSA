Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, check if there exists a pair whose sum equals the target. This is a variation of the 2Sum problem.

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
Output: true
Explanation: There is a pair (1, -3) with the sum equal to given target, 1 + (-3) = -2.

Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no pair with sum equals to given target.
